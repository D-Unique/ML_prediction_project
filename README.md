# PROJECT TITLE:    	    **Music Genre Prediction App❤️❤️**

**DESCRIPTION:**

This project explores music genre prediction using machine learning techniques. It aims to predict the type of music an individual might enjoy based on two input parameters: age and gender.
This project serves as a practical learning experience in machine learning and software engineering fundamentals.

**FEATURES:**

Functionality -> The application takes your age and gender as input in a web appication interface and leverages a trained machine learning model to predict your potential music genre preference which it also displays in the web interface.

Data Input ->  age(int, range limitations(20:50) and gender(values= MALE || FEMALE || m || f ).

Output -> It is displayed on the browser.
